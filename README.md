# Claude Code Configuration

Personal Claude Code configuration for Andrew Rich.

## Setup

When cloning this repository, you need to initialize the git submodules:

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:smartwatermelon/claude-config.git ~/.claude

# OR if already cloned, initialize submodules
cd ~/.claude
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### What Gets Initialized

- **agents/** - The wshobson/agents plugin marketplace (68 plugins, 153 agents)
- **plugins/marketplaces/superpowers-marketplace** - The obra/superpowers-marketplace

## Installed Plugins

### From claude-code-workflows Marketplace (via agents/ submodule)

15 plugins installed with 29 specialized agents:

**Code Quality & Review:**

- adversarial-review (1 agent)
- comprehensive-review (3 agents: code-reviewer, architect-review, security-auditor)

**Development Workflows:**

- git-pr-workflows, tdd-workflows
- debugging-toolkit, error-debugging

**Code Management:**

- code-refactoring, dependency-management, code-documentation

**Development Domains:**

- backend-development, frontend-mobile-development, unit-testing

**Production & Security:**

- security-compliance, incident-response, team-collaboration

### From superpowers-marketplace

- superpowers (core skills library for TDD, debugging, collaboration)

## Architecture

### Plugin Loading

```
~/.claude/
├── agents/                          # Git submodule → wshobson/agents
├── plugins/
│   └── marketplaces/
│       ├── claude-code-workflows   # Symlink → ../../agents
│       └── superpowers-marketplace # Git submodule → obra/superpowers-marketplace
├── settings.json                    # Which plugins are enabled
├── plugins/installed_plugins.json  # Runtime state (not tracked)
└── plugins/known_marketplaces.json # Runtime state (not tracked)
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Symlink uses relative path** (`../../agents`) for portability
2. **Runtime state files NOT tracked in git** - `installed_plugins.json` and `known_marketplaces.json` contain absolute paths and are regenerated by Claude Code
3. **Git submodules for marketplace sources** - Ensures latest plugin versions

### Runtime State

The following files are generated by Claude Code and are NOT tracked in git:

- `plugins/installed_plugins.json` - Contains absolute install paths
- `plugins/known_marketplaces.json` - Contains absolute marketplace locations

These files are regenerated based on:

- The symlink structure in `plugins/marketplaces/`
- The enabled plugins in `settings.json`

## Git Hooks

Automated code review hooks are configured in `hooks/` directory.

See `CLAUDE.md` for protocol documentation.
